2. AYPY_GND is the default Ground position, and should only be opened once Tower is open.

## Tower

1. AYPY_GND is the default position for Tower and is the first aerodrome position which should be opened.

#### Responsibilities
Jacksons Tower is responsible for the class C Jacksons CTR. Tower are also responsible for both runways. Ground are responsible for the remainder of the maneuvering area

#### Runway Selection
Jacksons Normally only uses one runway for operations at 14L/32R but if on the day Tower wants to open runway 14R/32R it will be used for light aircraft for IFR/VFR departures

#### Auto Release
Auto Release applies at Jacksons for aircraft:
-	Assigned a procedural SID from a runway nominated on the ATIS and;
-	Assigned the standard assignable level

All other departures require a release from Departures, via a ‘Next’ call.

Auto Release does not apply to:
-	VFR departures
-	Aircraft assigned the radar SID
-	Departures to aerodromes within the Jacksons TCU
-	High performance jet departures
-	All departures during Curfew nomination

Additionally, Tower will coordinate the following with Departures:
-	Go arounds/missed approach

#### Circuits
runway 14L and 32R - Left hand circuit . runway 14R and 32R - Right hand circuit 

> At no point are circuits to be authorised when cross runway operations or curfew nomination are being used.

#### Transfer to Departures
The frequency for departures will follow this priority order:

All departures:
| Runway 14L | Runway 32R | 
| -------- | ------- |
| AYPY_APP  | AYPY_APP | 
| AYPM_CTR  | AYPM_CTR |

## Ground

1.	AYPY_GND is the only ground position for  Jacksons. This position shall only be opened when AYPY_TWR is already online. 

#### Runway Release
When runway 14R/32L is not in use, ground may request a release of the runway. In this case the runway is owned by ground, and ground do not need to coordinate runway crossing

#### Transfer to Tower
Ground must transfer all aircraft to Tower when practical (no further ground traffic to effect). Reference the responsibility section. Where a runway is released to Ground, Ground will instruct aircraft to cross the inactive runway BEFORE transferring to Tower.

# APP

| Logon | Callsign | Frequency | FRA |
| -------- | ------- |
| AYPY_APP  |  Jacksons Radar |  125.800MHz |  AS2 |

1.	AYPY_APP is the standard position for Jacksons Radar. This position shall be opened first, and can be opened any time. 

## Approach 

#### Responsibilities
Jacksons Radar is responsible for the Jacksons TMA up to FL150

#### Approach Selection
The preferred instrument approach is the ILS for runway 14L, or the RNP for all other runways. Aircraft shall be informed of their expected approach type on initial contact with Approach. If aircraft request another type of approach, this request should be accomodated if possible.

#### Coordination with Centre
**Departures:**
> No coordination is required for tracking IFR aircraft through a procedural SID and assigned FL150. All other aircraft must be coordinated with the Moresby Centre. Aircraft will be delivered to the Center before leaving the TMA and must be conflict-free.

**Arrivals:**
> No coordination is required for IFR aircraft arriving at Jacksons assigned to a STAR and descending to 10,000 feet. All other aircraft must be coordinated through the Moresby Centre. Aircraft will be delivered to Approach before entering the TMA and must be conflict free.

# XO Operation Manuals
+ Melbourne, Brisbane, Auckland, Christchurch, Moresby
+ An open repository where all members can contribute to the Oceanic Operation Manuals.

Since July 2024 we are working on converting all Ops Manuals from PDF files to IVAO Wiki pages. All new Ops Manuals should follow the Wiki format. More information will be provided below. 

## How to Contribute
### Overview
Any member of the community may contribute this Ops Manuals so long as:
+ The data provided is factual and realistic.

### Ammending Old Ops Manuals
Ammending old Ops Manuals is very easy to do via GitHub. Simply create a branch of our repository, make the ammendments required, and then submit a pull request. 
It helps us enormously, and speeds up the process, if you can provide sources when submitting the pull request.

### Creating New Ops Manuals
Users currently cannot create new pages on our GitHub, however you may still produce new Ops Manuals, but they will need to be manually submitted to the ATC Operations Assistant Coordinator, Charlie Walton, via email or discord.

## Formatting

In order to correctly format Ops Manuals, a basic understanding of how the IVAO Wiki works is required. See a guide below:

'#' Main Title Header
'##' Smaller Title Header
'###' Sub-Header
'####' Smaller Sub-Header

The Title Headers will show in the glossery on the left hand side making it easier to find parts of the page. Sub-Headers do not. 

'> Text' Quotation (generally used for phraseology)

'> Text'       Information Box
'{.is-info}'

'> Text'       Green Tick Box
'{.is-success}'

'> Text'       Amber Warning Box
'{.is-warning}'

'> Text'       Red Cross Box
'{.is-danger}'

'**text**'     Bold
'*text*'       Italic

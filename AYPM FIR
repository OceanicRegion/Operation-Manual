#### Circuits 
AYPY: Circuits Runway 14L and 32L - Left Hand circuits 
      Circuits Runway 14R and 32R - Right Hand circuits 

AYNZ: Circuits Runway 27/09 Left Hand citcuits 


#### Runway Selection (AYPY) - (AYNZ)

AYPY: as Runway preference in AYPY are 14L and 14R or 32R and 32L for landing or takeoff normally Runway 14L or 32R is used Runway 14R and 32L can be used for landing or takeoff of light or medium aircraft depending on the total weight

AYNZ: The preferred runway at AYNZ is 09 and 27 for takeoff and landing 

(AYPY):STANDARD DEPARTURE CLEARANCES

Standard Departure Clearances (SDC) are produced to facilitate ATC clearance issued at airports affording IFR traffic separation. The SDC contains details of the route to be flown in the Control Zone (CTR) and Control Areas (CTA, TMA and UTA) and are valid until the point that the aircraft leaves controlled airspace.

The SDC number is coded in adjacent text. Where a DME DEPARTURE is published for the route, this is indicated in the text in BOLD PRINT. An asterisk (*) indicates that a DME DEPARTURE is available via a published diversionary route, available on request. At NZ for routes tracking via LARID, a Standard Departure Route is published. This does not affect the SDC issue however.

Normal provisions apply in relation to intercepting the cleared departure track by 5 miles. Except where specified the pilot in command is to ensure that the aircraft is navigated by reference to the navigational aid that affords the most precise track guidance.

Jacksons Radar (MINIMUN ALTITUDE)

This chart provides terrain clearance within boundaries defined by bearings and distances from the ARP. Altitudes shown are based on the highest terrain within each portion of the RTCC, including a minimum of 1000' for terrain clearance, the final value being rounded up to the next whole 100'.

The minimum altitudes shown do not guarantee that an aircraft will remain within VHF, navaid or radar coverage or within controlled airspace.

The RTCC serves as the basis for design and production of vectoring charts and procedures by or on behalf of ATC. The boundaries exist for the benefits of position fixing by radar so that ATC can authorize climb or descent as necessary during vectoring. Note that radar control will assign altitude in accordance with the altitude depicted on the RTCC, or 1000' above the relevant step in controlled airspace, whichever is higher.
